#Demonstrates the numeric data types in python
#Python supports 5 data types: Numeric, String, List, Tuple, Dictionary

#Numeric Data Types. 
#Numeric objects are created when an integer, floating point or complex integer value is assigned to the variable

#Signed Integer Numeric Data Types. These are either positive or negative numbers with no decimal points
#All integer numbers are represented as signed long numbers in python 3. There is no separate long type
#python 2 supports int and long.
length = 5
breadth = 10
bignumber=1000000000000000 #This number gets appended with L when printed.

#numbers can be preceded with 0 with no effect
#rate = 080

#Integer numbers can also be represented in Hexa decimal format

hexa_rate = 0x260
hexa_range = -0x26

#Integer numbers can be represented in Octal format
